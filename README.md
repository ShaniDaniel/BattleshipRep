# BattleshipRep
She-codes project repository

This is a game of battleship written in python.
The "Classes" folder contains the functionality and algorithms of the game, and the "UI" folder contains the files creating the user interface of the game and connecting the game functionality to it.
The "MainGame" file is the main file, importing from the different files and also containing the User interface of the different windows.

To run the program you need to have python 3 installed on your computer, to download the files in this repository to your computer and to install the packages in the "requirements.txt" file (assuming you have pip installed, you can do that with a simple command from the command prompt: "pip install -r requirements.txt").
